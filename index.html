    <p> Tags are what you will see the most when you look at any HTML source code. A tag can ideally be seen as a wrapper to any item on your HTML document. Tags tell what magic is to be done on the content enclosed by them.</p>

    <p>Let's look at two types of tags:</p>
    <ol>
        <li> &lt;tag-example-1&gt; I need a closing tag &lt;tag-example-1 &gt;</li>
        <li> &lt;tag-example-1/&gt;I don't need a closing tag. 
    </ol>
